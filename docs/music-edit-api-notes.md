# Music Edit API & UI Refactor Notes

**Date:** 2025-08-14

## Summary

This document records the changes made to support full-featured editing of music entries, including genres, tags, platform links, and tracklists, in the BugleWorldMusic admin panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Edit Page UI

- The edit page (`app/admin/music/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) was refactored to use a tabbed form, matching the create page.
- All fields, genres, tags, platform links, and tracklist are now editable.
- State is initialized from the fetched music entry and updates are sent as a single payload.

### 2. API Route Logic

- The API route (`app/api/music/[id]/route.ts`) PUT handler was refactored:
  - Now updates main music fields first.
  - Deletes all previous genre, tag, link, and track relations for the music entry.
  - Recreates new relations based on the submitted data.
  - Returns the updated music entry with all relations included.
- This avoids Prisma relation errors and ensures all changes are reflected in the database.

### 3. Bug Fixes

- Fixed Prisma compound key usage for join tables.
- Ensured that deleting and recreating relations does not violate required constraints.

## Impact

- Admins can now fully edit music entries, including all relations, from the UI.
- Data integrity is maintained and errors are avoided during updates.
