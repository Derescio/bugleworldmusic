## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Product  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Developer, Bugle (Artist)

### Decision

Build a comprehensive entertainer website for reggae artist Bugle that serves as a centralized platform for fan engagement, official merchandise sales, and professional booking services. The platform will feature music catalog, e-commerce functionality, and professional press kit resources.

### Context

Reggae fans currently navigate multiple fragmented platforms to access Bugle's content, leading to reduced engagement and unofficial merchandise sales. Industry professionals lack easy access to press materials and booking information. A unified platform can solve these issues while providing direct artist-to-fan communication channels.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Static Website**
   - Pros: Simple, low cost, fast development
   - Cons: No e-commerce, no user interaction, limited functionality

2. **Third-Party Platform Integration**
   - Pros: Leverage existing platforms, faster setup
   - Cons: Limited customization, platform dependency, fragmented experience

3. **Comprehensive Custom Platform** (Selected)
   - Pros: Full control, unified experience, scalable, professional presentation
   - Cons: Higher development cost, longer timeline

### Rationale

The comprehensive approach aligns with the multi-faceted needs of fans, industry professionals, and the artist. The investment in a custom platform provides long-term value through direct fan relationships, authentic merchandise sales, and streamlined professional services.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Direct fan engagement and community building
- Increased authentic merchandise sales
- Professional presentation for industry contacts
- Scalable platform for future growth
- Complete control over brand presentation

**Negative:**

- Higher initial development investment
- Ongoing maintenance requirements
- Need for content management processes

   - Cons: Limited customization, performance issues, security concerns

2. **Shopify + Custom Frontend**
   - Pros: Built-in e-commerce, payment processing
   - Cons: Platform limitations, monthly costs, limited customization

3. **Next.js Full-Stack** (Selected)
   - Pros: Modern development experience, excellent performance, SEO-friendly, full control
   - Cons: Requires more development expertise, custom implementation needed

### Rationale

Next.js provides the best balance of performance, developer experience, and scalability. The React ecosystem offers extensive libraries for required features like 3D graphics, animations, and e-commerce functionality.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Excellent performance and SEO capabilities
- Modern development experience with TypeScript
- Scalable architecture for future features
- Full customization control

**Negative:**

- Requires specialized React/Next.js development knowledge
- More complex setup than WordPress alternatives

## 2024-12-19: Development Workflow & Testing Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Process  
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Project Manager

### Decision

Implement comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. Establish pull request workflow with automated checks and review requirements.

### Context

User requested professional development workflow with testing suite and PR approval process. Need to ensure code quality and prevent production issues while maintaining development velocity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Testing Only**
   - Pros: Simple, no setup required
   - Cons: Error-prone, time-consuming, not scalable

2. **Basic Testing + Manual Deployment**
   - Pros: Some quality assurance, familiar process
   - Cons: Deployment bottlenecks, manual errors possible

3. **Comprehensive Testing + Automated CI/CD** (Selected)
   - Pros: High quality assurance, automated deployment, scalable process
   - Cons: Initial setup complexity, learning curve

### Rationale

Professional development workflow ensures code quality, reduces production bugs, and provides confidence in deployments. Automated testing and CI/CD enable faster, more reliable development cycles.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Higher code quality and fewer production bugs
- Automated deployment process
- Scalable development workflow
- Professional development standards

**Negative:**

- Initial setup time investment
- Learning curve for testing frameworks
- Need for PR approval workflow setup

## 2024-12-19: Content Management Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Content Manager

### Decision

Evaluate Sanity CMS vs PostgreSQL + Prisma for content management. Current implementation uses mock data, need to transition to dynamic content management for Phase 2.

### Context

Currently using mock data for music releases and products. Need scalable content management solution that allows non-technical updates while maintaining performance and developer experience.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Sanity CMS**
   - Pros: User-friendly interface, real-time collaboration, excellent developer experience
   - Cons: Additional service dependency, learning curve, monthly costs

2. **PostgreSQL + Custom Admin**
   - Pros: Full control, no external dependencies, cost-effective
   - Cons: More development work, need to build admin interface

3. **Hybrid Approach** (Under Consideration)
   - Pros: Flexibility to choose best tool for each content type
   - Cons: Complexity, multiple systems to maintain

### Rationale

Decision pending further evaluation of content management needs and technical requirements. Will be finalized in Phase 2 planning.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Dynamic content management capabilities
- Non-technical content updates
- Scalable content architecture

**Negative:**

- Additional complexity and potential costs
- Migration effort from mock data

## Decision 10: API Testing Strategy

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** âœ… Implemented  
**Context:** Need comprehensive testing coverage for API routes to ensure reliability and catch regressions

### Problem

API routes require thorough testing to:

- Validate request/response handling
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Ensure database integration works correctly
- Maintain code quality and prevent regressions

### Options Considered

1. **Manual Testing Only**
2. **Unit Tests with Vitest + Comprehensive Mocking**
3. **Integration Tests with Test Database**

### Decision

Implemented **Unit Tests with Vitest + Comprehensive Mocking** approach.

### Rationale

- Fast execution without external dependencies
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- TypeScript safety with proper mocking strategies
- Integrates well with existing Vitest setup
- Provides immediate feedback during development

### Implementation Details

- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: 23 tests across 5 API routes
- **Mocking Strategy**: Prisma client, NextResponse, UploadThing
- **Error Handling**: Database errors, validation failures, edge cases
- **TypeScript Issues**: Resolved with `@ts-expect-error` for complex Prisma types

### Routes Tested

- `/api/genres` - GET endpoint with error handling
- `/api/tags` - GET endpoint with error handling
- `/api/music` - GET/POST with pagination, validation, and error scenarios
- `/api/uploadthing/core` - File router configuration testing
- `/api/uploadthing/route` - Upload handler testing

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- High confidence in API reliability
- Fast test execution (< 2 seconds)
- Comprehensive error coverage
- TypeScript safety maintained
- Easy to maintain and extend

**Negative:**

- Complex mocking setup for Prisma
- TypeScript challenges with mock types
