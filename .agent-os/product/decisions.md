## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Product  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Developer, Bugle (Artist)

### Decision

Build a comprehensive entertainer website for reggae artist Bugle that serves as a centralized platform for fan engagement, official merchandise sales, and professional booking services. The platform will feature music catalog, e-commerce functionality, and professional press kit resources.

### Context

Reggae fans currently navigate multiple fragmented platforms to access Bugle's content, leading to reduced engagement and unofficial merchandise sales. Industry professionals lack easy access to press materials and booking information. A unified platform can solve these issues while providing direct artist-to-fan communication channels.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Static Website**
   - Pros: Simple, low cost, fast development
   - Cons: No e-commerce, no user interaction, limited functionality

2. **Third-Party Platform Integration**
   - Pros: Leverage existing platforms, faster setup
   - Cons: Limited customization, platform dependency, fragmented experience

3. **Comprehensive Custom Platform** (Selected)
   - Pros: Full control, unified experience, scalable, professional presentation
   - Cons: Higher development cost, longer timeline

### Rationale

The comprehensive approach aligns with the multi-faceted needs of fans, industry professionals, and the artist. The investment in a custom platform provides long-term value through direct fan relationships, authentic merchandise sales, and streamlined professional services.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Direct fan engagement and community building
- Increased authentic merchandise sales
- Professional presentation for industry contacts
- Scalable platform for future growth
- Complete control over brand presentation

**Negative:**

- Higher initial development investment
- Ongoing maintenance requirements
